# Teach Yourself, Teach Us

Today is an all-day structured exercise in developing the skill you're likely to use most in the Industry: teaching yourself something new.

By yourself or in a group, please pick a useful library or technology we have not covered in class. Then:

### Build something

...that demonstrates your subject. It should:
- Be published to a Github repository.
- Be small, with no more than 100 total lines of code, if possible (excluding comments).
- Be well-commented with notes.
- Be a good example of why someone might want to use your code.
- **Not** follow the [DTROTFO](https://i.imgur.com/RadSf.jpg) methodology.

### Document it

In your Github repository, include a `readme.md` that answers the following questions regarding your subject:

- Why did you choose this subject?
  - How were you first made aware of it?
- What problem does it solve?
  - How does it solve the problem (conceptually)?
- Why does one use it?
  - What are the alternatives?
  - What is it similar to, if anything?
- What is the history of this technology?
  - Who built it and why?
  - Who is maintaining it?
- What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?
- What are the biggest conceptual hurdles (if any) you encountered when researching this?
- What are 3 interview questions one might be asked about this technology?

Also, please include the instructions necessary to:

- Run your example.
  - Do I need to run `bower install`? Do I need an API key?
- Use your subject.
  - Do I need to include it in my HTML with `<script>` tags? Do I need to `brew install` anything? Can I deploy it to Heroku?
