# Sweet Libs

Created a color Picker app using Vue.js, tween.js, and color-js

## Experience

I heard Vue.js was one of the latest js libraries and I want to keep up with the latest trends. Vue is essentially a lightweight Angular.js and it renders super fast. The alternatives to Vue would be Angular, React, and other front end manipulation frameworks/libraries. It's scary similar to Angular and has the same syntax-ish.

My hurdles is (and always) just getting started. It takes a while for me to conceptualize what needs to be done. I think I was really productive for the last 3 hours. As for resources, I highly recommend the vue.js documentation.

3 interview questions
1)Instantiate a new Vue instance and return "hello world"
2)What is the difference between Vue and Angular?
3)How would you determine between using Vue or Angular?
