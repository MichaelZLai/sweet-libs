# Teach Yourself, Teach Us

Today is an all-day structured exercise in developing the skill you're likely to use most in the Industry: teaching yourself something new.

**Note: The deliverable for this (see below) counts as one homework grade.**

By yourself or with one or more others of your choosing, please pick a useful library or technology we have not covered in class. Then:

### Build something

...that demonstrates your subject. It should:
- Be published to a Github repository.
- Be very small, with no more than 50 total lines of code, if possible (**excluding comments**).
- Be well-commented with notes.
- Be a good example of why someone might want to use your code.
- **Not** follow the [DTROTFO](https://i.imgur.com/RadSf.jpg) methodology.

### Document it

In your Github repository, include a `readme.md` that answers the following questions regarding your subject. No need to write a book!

- Why did you choose this subject?
  - How were you first made aware of it?
- What problem does it solve?
  - How does it solve the problem (conceptually)?
- Why does one use it?
  - What are the alternatives?
  - What is it similar to, if anything?
- What is the history of this technology?
  - Who built it and why?
  - Who is maintaining it?
- What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?
- What are the biggest conceptual hurdles (if any) you encountered when researching this?
- What resources do you recommend for interested students?
  - What article or forum was most helpful to you in learning this?
- What are 3 interview questions one might be asked about this technology?

Also, please include the instructions necessary to:

- Run your example.
  - Do I need to run `bower install`? Do I need an API key?
- Use your subject.
  - Do I need to include it in my HTML with `<script>` tags? Do I need to `brew install` anything? Can I deploy it to Heroku?

## Suggestions for subjects
- React.js
- Meteor.js
- Python/Django
- Drupal/WordPress/PHP
- MongoDB && Mongoose
- Web Sockets and Socket.IO
- Ember.js

## Timeline

**NO LATER THAN 10:00am: ALL STUDENTS** must *individually* complete [this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1KjVHvcUXLot85EvQLWj5kezoW4v3AeVaEPpYAfk3UZ8/viewform?usp=send_form) asking you / your group's name (see the form for details) and what you're studying.

[Responses may be seen here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-JXmyVGUhxWcm_vNGLcer9MPWoa1S7OCnEXhVQLAjjY/pubhtml)

**NO LATER THAN 2:00: ALL STUDENTS** must submit a Git issue to the `teach_yourself` repository containing a link to their / their group's main repository. The issue must also include:

- Your comfort score (out of 5)
- Any particular sections of your code that you would like the instructors to review, and specific questions to guide our feedback.

**NO LATER THAN 2:30: ALL STUDENTS** must leave at least one comment on at least one other students' **issue** asking a question about what they studied -- their code example or their documentation. That's a pretty light order for the commenter, but extremely helpful for the commentee! See if you can push yourself to leave comments on 3 different repos. Take this opportunity to review what others studied and see how much you can learn.

**2:30: ALL STUDENTS** will re-convene in their classroom to debrief.
